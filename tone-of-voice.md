  At its core Console Connect is mostly serious, respectful and matter-of-fact,
  but also casual in tone.

# Tone of Voice

Console Connect takes lengthy, complex processes and makes them as simple as possible. It is important this be reflected in our tone of voice. With a "work harder not smarter" attitude, tone is fairly **relaxed** and **friendly**, yet always **to-the-point**.

{% hint style="info" %}
When writing for Console Connect, ask yourself "**What would a helpful human say?**"
{% endhint %}

## 1. More serious than funny

Networks and data breaches are a serious business. On the rare occasion, Console Connect might be a little humorous but its general tone approaches topics in a serious way.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Don't attempt humour when dealing with an important or serious topic, e.g "Oops, looks like someone unplugged something!"
{% endhint %}

## 2. Fairly casual

Even when serious, tone can still be casual and friendly. Console Connect is definitely professional but isn't overly formal.

This simply means to **write in the first person** and **be conversational**. Use phrases such as "We're sorry..." rather than "Console Connect apologizes".
